I need to see the actual LLM output analysis to evaluate it. The input you've provided shows an empty analysis object `{"trend": "sample trend", "analysis": {}}`. 

Please provide the complete ad copy analysis output from the generator LLM that includes:
- The specific market trend being analyzed
- The executive summary
- Key findings
- Strategic recommendations
- Any other analysis components

Once you share the actual analysis content, I'll evaluate it across all six dimensions (Specificity, Strategic, Impactful, Non-obvious, Actionability, and Clarity) and provide the detailed JSON assessment as requested.

For example, the analysis should look something like:
```json
{
  "trend": "AI-powered productivity tools",
  "analysis": {
    "executive_summary": "...",
    "findings": [...],
    "recommendations": [...],
    // other analysis components
  }
}
```

Please share the complete analysis output so I can provide a thorough evaluation.
