Detailed (15%): the insights should be specific, providing granular details around the Lenovo brand/products/features, customer or competitor behaviors, and should try to explain the why behind specific trends.When mentioning/referencing a product, there should be a specific feature attributed in the insight. For Eg : when talking about Dell’s Alienware, people are talking about its display quality.

Impactful (20%): the insight should drive a measurable shift in client priorities.

    Here is an example of an extremely good insight:
    Dell is running a significant 'Black Friday in July' sales event, offering discounts on both laptops and gaming monitors. Notably, the Alienware 27-inch QD-OLED 4K Gaming Monitor is on sale for $599, which is $300 off its regular price - close to 35%  off. Targeting keywords such as 'gaming monitor', '4K gaming monitor' used by competitors but not Lenovo—can help Lenovo capture demand from price-sensitive and performance-focused gamers, especially during major sales events. Messaging should emphasize Lenovo Legion's advanced features, competitive pricing, and availability during promotional periods to stay top-of-mind in this highly competitive segment.
    

    Here is an example of a poor insight:
    There is significant news activity and heavy paid search promotion by competitors around desktops and laptops, especially during major sales events like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday in July. Competitors are featured in top deal roundups and are actively launching and branding new products, including AI-powered PCs. Lenovo is mentioned in reviews but is not as prominent in paid search or promotional activity. To remain competitive and capture demand during these high-traffic periods, Lenovo should strongly consider including this keyword category in its paid search strategy. This can help capture demand from customers searching for deals during these sales periods.
